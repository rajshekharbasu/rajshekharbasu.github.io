                                <h4>Part 1</h4>
                                <p>The first part of the piece is centered about the desperate nature of tourists wanting special photographs. Tourists don't like other tourists because it reminds them of where they are trying to escape from. That is why every tourist tries to eat a unique dish, visit a special place and do something no other tourist has done. The exclusivity of having done a unique task gives them a sense of pride and bragging rights to their circle of people.</p>
                                
                                <h4>Part 2</h4>
                                <p>The second part of the piece is a more positive one. It is similar to the 3rd iteration. It tackles the problem of overcrowding in tourist hotspots and the freedom/lack of responsibility a tourist experiences when on holiday. The sea of water has been replaced with a sea of tourists sunbathing. The sunbathing tourists look devoid of life because that is the nature of tourists who do not value the experience over momentary pleasure.</p>
                                
                                <h4>Part 3</h4>
                                <p>The third piece is the least abstract and shortest of the three. It shows a more almost dystopian travel agency which is a repurposed photo studio where people pay for their photos to be taken at exclusive travel destinations without travelling anywhere. It highlights the superficial nature that tourism is heading in.</p>

                                <p>The theme of my project, centered around the myth of Sisyphus and the concept of Absurdism, was chosen due to a fascination with the human experience of struggle and the search for meaning in an indifferent universe. In a world where challenges often seem insurmountable and purpose elusive, I am intrigued by how individuals navigate their own "boulders" in life. This exploration of resilience and personal growth through interactive engagement allows participants to reflect on their own experiences while engaging with the timeless narrative of Sisyphus. By transforming this myth into a physical interactable virtual experience, I aim to provoke thought about the nature of existence and the potential for finding joy in the struggle itself.</p>

                                <p>I have built a playable game involving a boulder which constantly rolls down and you as a player have to navigate around a hellish landscape to try and push it up the slope. Due to the game being my first game it had its fair share of problems, but I gave them new meaning with the context of my topic. At times the boulder stopped rolling, that was because it was not a perfect sphere and some deformities made it sit on the slope. It moved much slower but the benefit was that it would not roll back. This can be seen as the slow and steady approach as compared to the high risk high reward case when the ball rolls. At times, the player wonders how far they have left to reach the end, but they can not do that. Life is lived through our perspective and that is why the game is in the first person and you took people some time to get used to the controls as the boulder rushed past them at the start. Eventually most of the players could manage the controls but could not reach the end. The ones who did reach the end, felt satisfaction in completing a difficult task. These small decisions and fortunate bugs in the games really added character to my game and gave it a whole new meaning for the players playing it.</p>

                                <p>These six rooms tell a story about how the places we build can impact us in ways we never saw coming. The first brutalist room where fog drifts through windows shows how the unknown always finds ways into our carefully ordered world. Walking through corridors that slowly close in reminds us of how our choices can narrow when we feel trapped by circumstance. The white room with footsteps above turns our sense of up and down upside down, suggesting that what we take for granted might easily be reversed. The black and white sea appearing at both floor and ceiling removes all sense of direction, placing us in a between-space where ordinary rules no longer apply. Tables breaking apart into glitchy fragments show how things we rely on daily can suddenly lose their meaning and purpose. The panopticon at the end reveals our truth: we exist always as both observers and observed, never truly separate from what we witness. Throughout this journey, these spaces suggest that our buildings—our attempt to make sense of the world—actually reveal how easily our perception can shift, bend, or break entirely. The walls we build to organize our lives might be telling us more about the fragility of understanding than about our space.</p>
                                <p>The audio design mirrors our journey through shifting realities. Layered synths and ambient crowds create emotional architecture, transforming subtly with each new environment. Like the spaces themselves, these sounds blur boundaries between observation and experience, reinforcing how perception exists in the uncertain territory between reality and mind.</p>
